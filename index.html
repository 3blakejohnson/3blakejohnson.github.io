        <h2 id="interests">My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my all-time favorite things to do is to ski. There&#39;s nothing better 
            than zooming down a mountain with the cold, crisp air whooshing across your face and past your ears. 
            I started skiing when I was probably around 9 or 10 years old, and have loved it ever since. Whenever I 
            can find a deal on skiing, I jump on it and seize the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one of my hobbies is Golf. I started golfing when I was around 10 years 
            old, and really only went because I wanted to drive the golf cart. Overtime, however, I realized that it 
            was actually fun. I started out always going with my dad, and later started going with my friends. A couple 
            of my friends were on the High School golf team, so I always felt like I wasn't a very good golfer when I 
            went with them, because I would always score a lot higher than them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I also have always had a love for technology. It started out with my fascination 
            for computers and video games when I was young, and continued to grow as more technological advances came 
            about. In High School, I took lots of programming classes, and realized it was very interesting to me. 
            That's when I decided to study Computer Science in College, and now here I am!
